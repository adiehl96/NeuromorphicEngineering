# Implementation of a Random Number Generator on the Arduino MKR Vidor 4000
This project is part of the course Neuromorphic Engineering 2122 at Radboud University.

## Usage
This branch is used to store the first phase of our project in the Neuromorphic Engineering Course. The files in this branch can be used to run a random number generating algorithm on the Arduino MKR Vidor 4000. Check out the main branch for the final result of this project.
