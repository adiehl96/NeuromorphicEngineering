# [WIP] Implementation of a Distributed Shortest Path Algorithm on FPGA
This project is part of the course Neuromorphic Engineering 2122 at Radboud University. 

## Usage
Open the project in dev/phase01/quartus in quartus and compile the bitstream. Use the steps detailed in the [JTAG repository](https://github.com/HerrNamenlos123/JTAG_Interface) to place it on the device. Further communication takes place via the serial monitor, where you can enter the numbers of the vertices you want to use as initial and terminal vertices.
